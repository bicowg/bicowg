# Carbon Footprint Calculator Repo


The role of this open-source, public repository is to share carbon footprint calculators for the blockchain ecosystem, that can support validators, protocols, dApps, DAOs, NFT auctions, and investors identifying and calculating their carbon footprint, reporting this footprint, and seeking carbon offsets to address this footprint.

Together, the blockchain community can become carbon neutral.

## Blockchain-Based Carbon Footprint Calculators

### Validators and Protocols

#### POS_Carbon Footprint Calculator

Developed by Brecht Deriemaeker, Copyright 2021 [Regen Network Development Inc](https://www.regen.network/)
License: Apache 2.0
Methodology transparency: publicly available

Validator Footprints: This calculator allows validators in POS networks to estimate their carbon footprint by reporting flights, home offices, virtual CPUs, and physical data centers.

Network Footprints: While it is ideal that all validators report their carbon footprint, the following recommendations are a minimum viable approach to determine a network footprint estimate.

1.  A minimum of 3 validators per network must complete the POS calculator tool. The average of these 3 footprint estimates can be used to determine a protocol footprint estimate using this formula:
    
    [ validator footprint average * number of validators = network carbon footprint ]

*Pro Tip*: For validators that work on multiple networks, it is important to acknowledge the years and networks each use of this calculator applies against (ie. 3 years operations on 4 networks) to ensure footprints on a protocol level are not over estimated.

#### Non-Fungible Token Carbon Footprint Calculators
FungyProof [NFT NRG Matrix](https://github.com/FungyProof/nrg-matrix)
Developed by [FungyProof](https://www.fungyproof.com/)
Methodology transparency: publicly available

A reference guide for understanding the energy consumption of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) participants on the current Proof of Work (POW) Ethereum network.

[Carbon.Fyi NFT Calculator](https://carbon.fyi/learn)
Developed by [Offsetra](https://offsetra.com/)
Methodology transparency: publicly available [Methodology](https://www.notion.so/Carbon-FYI-Methodology-51e2d8c41d1c4963970a143b8629f5f9)

An ETH wallet’s footprint is derived from the sum of Ethereum Gas consumed for transactions leaving your wallet, multiplied by a best-guess estimated emissions factor. The emissions factor was derived from the energy mix and geographic location of Ethereum mining pools.

### Term Glossary

Net Zero: A state where the organization’s activities result in no net impact on the climate from greenhouse gas emissions.

**Carbon Neutral:** A state where greenhouse gas emissions are offset with the equivalent amount of carbon credits to compensate for emissions.

**Carbon ‘Negative’ or Climate ‘Positive’:** Removing more CO2 from the atmosphere than your company emits.

**Carbon Removal:** Carbon removal projects are those that remove and sequester CO2. A carbon credit is issued for every ton of CO2 removed.

**Avoided Emissions:** Avoided emissions projects are those that result in fewer emissions compared to a hypothetical business-as-usual scenario (or baseline). Carbon credits are issued for every avoided ton of CO2 equivalent.
