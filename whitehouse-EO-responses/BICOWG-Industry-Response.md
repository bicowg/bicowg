# Blockchain Infrastructure Carbon Offset Working Group Climate Crypto Industry Response to the White House Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets

**May 9, 2022**
Senior Administration Officials
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, DC 20500


**RE: Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets**

Dear concerned federal administrators,

The Blockchain Infrastructure Carbon Offsetting Working Group (BICOWG) respectfully submits the following comments to the recent Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets. The BICOWG is a brain trust of climate crypto experts drawn from blockchain protocols, organizations, and individuals supporting coordination, providing education, developing tooling, hosting forums, and providing clearinghouse services[^1].

[^1]:  Many of whom participate in the Celo Climate Collective: [https://climatecollective.org/](https://climatecollective.org/)

The Executive Order on _[Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/)_ outlines the first government strategy to protect consumers, financial stability, National security, and addresses climate risks. Similarly, the Executive Order defines goals to protect consumers and businesses currently using digital assets from threats to data privacy and financial security. It also articulates a goal to create conditions of financial inclusion and equity, human rights and responsible energy usage in the sectors using digital assets[^2].

In response to the Executive order, the [BICOWG](https://bicowg.org/) along with over 30 blockchain projects and Web3 projects sitting at the intersection of climate and crypto would like to take this opportunity to present an industry response: An invitation to officials and organizations for a comprehensive dialogue around datapoints and use-cases at the intersection of digital assets, climate change, and blockchain technology. The BICOWG coalition believes that organizations using Web3 tools to finance climate change reversal are best positioned to assist regulators in determining how to achieve the goals that the White House sets forth.

## **Summary of findings:**

Overall, the BICOWG urges the government, as it moves forward to implement this order, to acknowledge that the United States seeks to promote innovation in the finance sector using web3 tools, in order to enhance public welfare and ecosystem health and radically decentralize average individual access to and governance of financial resources. The organizations using blockchain and digital assets to build decentralized bridges facilitating access to carbon market finance provide grounding case studies of how these web3 tools can transform the finance sector for the better: in order to rapidly achieve social progress such as climate change reversal.

## 1.  Problems in the Carbon Offset Market & How Web3 tools can Solve Them
    

### Carbon markets are failing to solve the ultimate market failure: blockchain-based tools can reform the sector’s impact

The authors of this comment are participating in a sector currently using digital assets and blockchain technology (henceforth referred to as web3[^3] technology) to drive increased technological innovation as well as investment at scale in the natural capital and climate solutions ecosystem[^4]. Web3 technology provides tools for attaching value to positive externalities[^5] of conventional economic markets, which then manifest a suite of solutions to the problems of the consumer and industry[^6]. Specifically, the goal of all carbon markets, whether international or domestic, voluntary or mandatory, is to direct sizable capital to projects reversing climate change[^7]. Yet, the inadvertent consequence of centralized administration of carbon markets -- by governments and private actors and equally centralized intermediary institutions distributing funds to carbon offset projects -- is that roadblocks remain on the path to ensure that the highest potential impact projects are actually receiving funds from these highly capitalized[^8] offset markets[^9].

An increasing pool of engineering, entrepreneurial, and creative talent within the United States are engineering crypto-economic systems that aim to cultivate balance between members of society who conventionally have access to financial systems and those who do not[^10]. The decentralized infrastructure and radical transparency of blockchain-based organizations allows these conditions to arise in the web3 sector. Thus many financial services companies using web3 call themselves Decentralized Finance (DeFi) companies. Those who are applying DeFi technology to the task of creating conditions for community and ecosystem vitality often label their projects as Regenerative Finance or ReFi projects, and view Web3 technologies and digital assets as essential alternative tools for achieving their mission, compared with traditional Wall Street-based financing vehicles[^11].

Organizations working in the United States have the opportunity to innovate carbon offset strategy using web3 tools: one that facilitates immense coordination between all existing governmental and non-governmental organizations working on climate action. Traditional carbon markets can make significant progress towards efficiency, auditability, and effectiveness with the adoption of blockchain technology. As we explain in the next section, this is because the technology has an inherently robust and resilient system of account that enables remarkable levels of transparency and innovation in composability.

### Web3 tools are well-positioned to transform access to carbon market finance

A combination of decentralized power structures[^12], interest inflexible, remote career opportunities among young generations, and explosive interest in cryptocurrencies have rendered the blockchain industry the fastest-growing sector for job creation[^13]. The United States is rightly taking an interest in how to craft regulations that support the expanding number of companies seeking to use these tools to incorporate in the country, and ensure they develop with integrity. The BICOWG also would like to emphasize that our federal government has the opportunity to regulate the development of the web3 space to support the thriving of democratic DeFi entities attempting to expand the accessibility of their sectors to average Americans. By generating the benefits detailed below, the web3 sector promises to provide an unprecedented number of innovative start-ups and organizations with access to the capital they need to make social and environmental impact:

### Benefits stemming from the decentralized nature of web3 tools

#### **_Fundraising and public goods_**

Many blockchain-based entities, incorporated as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), utilize the transparent, open-sourced nature of their blockchains to spread innovation and project support across an entire field with unprecedented efficiency. These projects help ensure innovation is well-funded across impact, crypto, and “common goods” by helping thousands of projects and teams grow their open-source ecosystems.

Some examples include:

-   Grant ecosystems like Giveth and Gitcoin are prime examples of this dynamic. These ecosystems provide flexible and extraordinarily efficient platforms for immediate fundraising of public goods via blockchain-based crypto payments that are sourced globally and immediately.
    
-   Decentralized energy grids like the [Brooklyn Microgrid Project](https://www.brooklyn.energy/about) are using smart contracts to give consumers the ability to produce and trade solar electricity with their neighbors through an exchange that uses a blockchain as a coordination mechanism. Using a decentralized and permissionless system to provide immediate auditability and censorship-resistant coordination and payment rails that can be just as rapidly scaled beyond a township or city has been a remarkable use-case in action–contributing directly to climate positive engagement.
    

**High-potential area of development: Stablecoins**

Stablecoins are at the vanguard of digital money, functioning as tokenized deposits. The US deposit market is more than $22 trillion, which funds mortgages, personal loans, small business loans, farm loans and other local economic development[^14]. At the same time, Americans are increasingly seeking their money to be invested in causes they care about, such as combating climate change. Catalyzing deposits towards this endeavor would enable ordinary Americans to deploy their money towards natural capital and create market-based incentives for rewarding carbon capture activities. For example, stablecoins can be backed by a portfolio of carbon negative assets: 1) deposits held across community banks and credit unions that do not fund fossil fuel businesses and provide loans to help businesses decarbonize, 2) carbon credits generated from decarbonization activities, 3) other natural capital, which may include water and reforestation, 4) state-issued green bonds, and 5) other liquid vehicles that provide funding for improving ecological outcomes[^15].

[^15]: Similar to the manner in which companies are using blockchains to create value stores for ecosystem service credits. See: Celo Foundation, “A Carbon Negative Blockchain? It’s Here and it’s Celo,” Medium, (May 26th, 2021).


Engaged parties need to work with regulators to make this possible to ensure natural capital backed stablecoins are financially sound with adequate consumer protection. Consumer confidence and trust is of utmost importance in ensuring the success of natural capital backed stablecoins.

### _Flexibility facilitating coordination_

The inherent affordance of programmability and composability on blockchains gives developers, organizations, and consumers immediate ease and flexibility of use. Fractionalization of asset ownership can be done with a few lines of code and simultaneously distributed to hundreds of thousands to millions of owners across the globe. Customizable streaming payments can be routed through a near unlimited number of composable DeFi products engaging complex but completely transparent and auditable logic all in a single transaction. Real world assets, like carbon credits, can be tokenized and anchored on the blockchain with all accompanying metadata, certificates, and proof of authenticity and be made accessible immediately to a completely global and open ecosystem ready to be integrated, used, and consumed by any participant.

Such “Regenerative” focused Finance ( Refi ) projects can include the foundational scaffolding of on-chain carbon markets like carbon bridges[^16] that tokenize carbon credits (Toucan Protocol, Flow Carbon, C3), sovereign blockchains that build out an entire vertical of infrastructure specifically for climate-focused data availability, transaction, and composability (Regen Network), and regenerative focused decentralized finance applications (KlimaDAO) which establish carbon and climate positive asset backed derivatives to be used seamlessly across the entire crypto ecosystem.

[^16]: Carbon Bridges are further defined / explained on section: Regulating decentralized vs. centralized carbon market intermediaries (Carbon Bridges)

**Potential case study: Web3 to aid implementation of wildfire executive order**

On Earth Day, President Biden signed an Executive Order to Strengthen America’s Forests, Boost Wildfire Resilience, and Combat Global Deforestation, which claims the federal government will attempt to “enlist nature to address the climate crisis with comprehensive efforts to deploy nature-based solutions that reduce emissions and build resilience.”[^17] The order lays out the objectives to make our nation more resilient to extreme weather and strengthen local economies. It aims to achieve these goals by facilitating transfer of public funds to holistic landscape management work; funds sourced from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that calls for prioritizing the restoration of old-growth forests.

[^17]: The White House Briefing Room, “President Biden Signs Executive Order to Strengthen America’s Forests, Boost Wildfire Resilience, and Combat Global Deforestation,” Statements and Releases, Fact Sheet, (April 22, 2022) [Link.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/22/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-to-strengthen-americas-forests-boost-wildfire-resilience-and-combat-global-deforestation/)


The order claims that agencies implementing this order will work in partnership with states, Tribal Nations, communities, industry, NGOs, labor, scientists, and private landowners, to strengthen our forests while creating good-paying jobs.

**The executive order clarifies** the (1) data (2) practitioners and (3) fund streams that will be harnessed to accomplish this order’s goals:

-   **Data**: The order mandates the DOI and USDA to conduct the first-ever inventory of mature and old-growth forests on federal lands. This will be completed and made publicly available in a year and will establish consistent definitions, accounting for regional and ecological variation.
    
-   **Partners**: DOI and USDA will partner with other federal agencies, states, Tribal Nations, and any interested private landowners to better coordinate conservation and wildfire risk reduction efforts.
    
-   **Funding**: Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides $8 billion to fund forest and land management activities, and the FY 2022 Omnibus provides $5.7 billion for wildland fire management and related risk mitigation and research. USDA and DOI are mobilizing $5 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for hazardous fuels reduction and other mitigation programs, such as a $1 billion Community Wildfire Defense Grant program and $600 million for firefighter pay.
    

Web3 tools are designed to coordinate these three areas, thus the infrastructure of a web3 financial services company will render these goals infinitely more achievable: All agencies and organizations relevant to executing this order could be invited to participate in the DAO forums, which could be organized by region. Organizations with technological capacity to collect data to measure the impact of the work of all these stakeholders could join the DAO to verify ecosystem impact and its relationship with wildfire prevention. Finally, financial incentives for participation could be distributed in the form of tokens, backed by taxpayer dollars and even funds from carbon offset markets[^18]. This case study clarifies how web3 technology and digital assets could create an implementation pathway for a new Civilian Conservation Corp[^19] that regenerates land health, funded by government funds as well as carbon offset market funds.

#### _Transparency_
Blockchain and cryptocurrencies enable traditional finance and businesses to access and build on Voluntary Carbon Markets in a transparent[^20] and verifiable manner[^21]. Along with issuance and exchange of completed carbon offsets, blockchains enable real life datapoints around soil health, climate etc. to move “on chain” and contribute to digital monitoring, reporting and verification of projects.

Projects such as [Regen.Network](http://regen.network) and dClimate enable the ability to value ecological assets and bring such “eco-credits” to market. Meanwhile, insurance projects like [Arbol](https://www.coindesk.com/chainlink-to-provide-data-for-farming-insurance-startup-arbol) and [Etherisc](https://blog.etherisc.com/etherisc-teams-up-with-chainlink-to-deliver-crop-insurance-in-kenya-137e433c29dc) offer smart contract-powered crop insurance to farmers across the world. This allows farmers to insure against bad weather with the oracles triggering payouts based on weather events[^22]. In all these use cases, impact is transparently recorded according to geographic location and project participants, eliminating the risk of double counting.

### _Composability and interoperability: Smart contracts & liquidity._

The composability afforded by the blockchain technology stack allows native and interoperable applications by default. This means that messaging, data exchange, and communication across the verticals of financial transactions to synchronous (and asynchronous) application use all are handled seamlessly.

Web3 tools create the ability for financial service organizations to exercise carbon accounting in the most financially efficient parts of the market. Frictionless transfers of assets with a myriad of flexible integrations and applications means both consumers and producers can benefit from markets that mold to their needs. Web3 under the context of the climate ecosystem allows “unique digital units” (units) to be created within any of three central use cases: (1) Certificates of commodities, (2) certificates of corporate ESG claims[^23] and living/dynamic automation of agreements. These units[^24] can be turned into assets, which in turn can be sold to other companies having trouble meeting climate goals. In this way the DeFi space is engineering ‘green money legos’ that can be mixed and matched to create a plethora of products, applications, and use cases. In the climate space, there are many “green money” legos, innovated not only for climate investment. This separates the climate crypto space in web3 from traditional web-based projects. For example, there are limited potential uses for Carbon credits within traditional web-based systems. An entity can only buy so many, and their only uses entail buying, reselling and flipping them. These uses contrast sharply with all of what is possible within web3 systems[^25]. Web3 climate crypto organizations are working on applying carbon credits to bioregional ecosystem restoration[^26], Amazonian rainforest conservation[^27], and much more:

[^23]: Which are essential for SEC regulations relating to the carbon emissions of public companies.

[^24]: Specific to unit of account: carbon unit attached to certificate, used for corporate ESG reporting who need to account for carbon deficit.

[^25]: Which is why there is an explosion of new blockchain-based projects seeking access to carbon market funds.

[^26]: See: [https://www.regen.network/](https://www.regen.network/)

[^27]: See: [Moss.Earth](https://www.moss.earth)



-   Carbon credits are being bridged through Toucan Protocol, put into a vault at KlimaDAO and being used to create carbon asset backed stablecoins.
    
-   Apps like [Sadu](https://sadu.app/) engineer conscious consumption by tracking habits and linking them to the carbon footprint. They can also be coordinated at an organizational level to engineer organizational climate consciousness. Etc.
    
-   Crypto-asset wrapping entities like Ren Protocol can natively offset any wrapped crypto asset at inception to engineer a ‘green asset’ that is carbon neutral from the get go
    
-   On-chain marketplaces can natively and automatically integrate carbon offsets to purchases and trades on decentralized exchanges
    
-   NFT grading services and analytics companies like FungyProof can provide carbon emissions accounting and offsetting on demand to the granular transaction level of the blockchain
    

If the sector is regulated with the right expertise, companies could be generating their own insetting claims with the same level of rigor as offsetting. Companies can sell these units as offsets on the market in a far more capital efficient way. Then, these assets can be passed on as certificates within the supply chain of consumer goods.

Furthermore, Blockchains enable conscious consumption by aggregating and depersonalizing data collection: While many consumers are already changing their consumption habits on their own, a wider societal shift in behavior will likely require aligning financial incentives with more sustainable consumer decisions. Through the use of smart contracts connected to real-world data, consumers can automatically receive payments or penalties based on the impact of their consumption habits, creating behavioral changes that simply would not have occurred through education alone[^28].

The composability of these financial units create flexible pathways for incentivizing a range of companies, organizations and individuals to focus on carbon removal; to innovate and bring new projects and products to carbon offset marketplaces[^29].  Furthermore, Web3 organizational and cryptocurrency infrastructure allows all these value units and organizations to be interoperable: it allows them to form partnership and exchange assets easily. The Regen blockchain is specifically being built to make such infrastructural interoperability between “climate crypto” and other web3 projects possible.

#### _Coordination_

Decentralized coordination tools have enabled immediate and meritocratic coordination tools that rest natively on blockchain and are accessible to everyone. The global scale of access this provides contributors on a level of equity has been unprecedented and has allowed a vibrant mix of diverse cultural and meaningful collaboration.

However, regulators should note that this is the one area of Web3 development that could benefit most from value-aligned regulation from a central authority. Coordination among network participants is much easier in a centralized system, as it can be handled by a central authority. This central authority can compel network participants to adopt upgrades, protocol updates, or change behavior. Coordination is often difficult with decentralized, blockchain-based networks, as no single agent has the final say in network-level decisions, protocol upgrades and so on. In the worst case, decentralized networks are prone to fracturing when there are disagreements about protocol changes[^30].

### Due to these benefits, Web3 tools have the power to unlock the full potential of carbon markets to build a climate-neutral society

Within this rapidly expanding blockchain sector, the United States is witnessing a “cambrian explosion” of organizations using web3 tools to access carbon market finance in revolutionary ways. These companies and projects promise to unlock the potential of participants in the U.S. market to capture funds from both domestic and international carbon markets, and leverage them towards high-impact climate change reversal work. These projects can (1) be interoperable with traditional carbon market projects that already exist but also (2) entirely change pathways of organizations woking to move capital from carbon offset markets sourced from all over the world, to highly localized projects located regionally. Distinguishing them from web-based organizations, Web3 organizations offer radical transparency that create the possibility of tremendous capital inflows from carbon markets. This fact is grounded by Flow Carbon’s recent tremendous market capitalization[^31]. Even in the next few weeks, Web3 organizations aiming to access carbon credit capital, “Climate crypto” companies, will go public and will receive tremendous valuations[^32].

Therefore, now is the time for the U.S. to create favorable regulatory conditions so that these revolutionary organizations incorporate domestically as they strive to build transparent and high-integrity flows of carbon market capital into the rapidly expanding sector of climate change activism and development in our country.

## 2. Specific Issues informing Regulatory needs within the Carbon Market Digital Asset Sector (Climate Crypto)
    

### Web3 digital asset tools promise to contribute efficiency and integrity to carbon market institutions

1.  #### How existing carbon market institutions can be greatly enhanced by Web3 tools
    

The climate crypto sector is populated by organizations utilizing Web3 tools in pursuit of reforming the “carbon bridges”[^33] that connect carbon offset market financial flows with projects working to capture carbon through technologies or ecosystem stewardship. Many projects are doing so merely to increase the efficiency of matching carbon market funds with impactful projects, not transform the process. Others have a goal of using web3 tools to dramatically transform the process of transferring funds from carbon offset markets to project ecosystems.

[^33]: A term used to refer to carbon market intermediaries: The organizations issuing carbon credits and verifying project impact in the process of transferring carbon market funds to projects.


### Regulating decentralized vs. centralized carbon market intermediaries (Carbon Bridges)

Within the Web3 carbon bridge space, organizations are forming on a spectrum of decentralization. Some bridges don’t have completely decentralized components across their entire stack out of necessity of facilitating coordination between Web2 organizations and that of Web3, such as C3 and Flow Carbon. Others are entirely decentralized like Toucan Protocol which provides more elements of complete user control along the process.

The regulatory questions raised by these two structures are different due to their differing interactions with existing carbon credit registries. A very decentralized bridge like Toucan is not necessarily in full partnership with existing registries. On the other hand, a centralized bridge like Flow Carbon is trying to be an ally to these registries, like Gold Standard Registry[^34]. These varying strategies of interaction with existing registries determine which flaws from the original web-based carbon offset financial system will transfer into Web3 climate crypto organizations; regardless of whether they are using technologies that allow for radically transparent and decentralized conditions. One of the most significant flaws that might transfer, which is currently preventing carbon offset markets from financing mass-scale, successful climate change reversal development, is difficulty of access to fund pools.

[^34]: See: [https://www.flowcarbon.com/about](https://www.flowcarbon.com/about)



### Decentralized carbon bridges create possibility of radicalizing access to carbon credit funds to allow mass-scale carbon offset investment

A decentralized carbon bridge like Toucan Protocol is on a mission to tokenize carbon credits[^35]. It will bridge these credits onto blockchain-based Web3 platforms[^36]. Once recorded on a blockchain, these credits can be put into liquidity pools or exchanges that are relevant, creating a scenario in which anyone in the world can access them.

[^35]: See: [https://docs.toucan.earth/protocol/bridge/carbon-bridge](https://docs.toucan.earth/protocol/bridge/carbon-bridge)

[^36]: This entails encoding their value on a blockchain node to make it permanent, transparent record. See also: Toucan Protocol, Bridge, Toucan Docs. [Link.](https://docs.toucan.earth/protocol/bridge/carbon-bridge)


This method contrasts sharply with the account list the Verra carbon market has online, for example. On this platform, only a very limited number of individuals have access to these carbon credits[^37]. This is the way Flow Carbon is designing their platform as well.

[^37]: See: [https://verra.org/registry-system/](https://verra.org/registry-system/)


### Beyond access, innovative funding mechanisms: Smart Contracts

Furthermore, Web3 has the potential to innovate different funding mechanisms and asset types sourced from capital within carbon markets. The potential for these technologies is embodied in the form and function of smart contracts, which were recently highlighted by the World Economic Forum as a key tool for implementing climate change development strategies[^38]. Smart contracts allow Web3 organizations to design “globally accessible and fully automated incentive systems that can directly reward individuals, companies, and governments for taking part in sustainable practices – such as regenerative agriculture, carbon offsets, crop insurance and more.”[^39] Regen Network and many other impact-oriented companies in this space are relying on smart contracts to bindingly commit digital currency flows to the impact users intend[^40].

[^38]: See: Adelyn Zhou, “Blockchain can help us beat climate change. Here's how,” World Economic Forum, (June 30th, 2021). [Link.](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/06/blockchain-can-help-us-beat-climate-change-heres-how/)

The transparency of these contracts, once they are on-chain, will allow two parties to track the ecosystem services generated through the contractual relationship, allowing for their immediate compensation[^41]. Smart contracts will allow Web3 intermediaries to facilitate fund transfers from existing government programs, such as the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service’s payment program for riparian zones and the Conservation Stewardship Program. Due to the decentralized structure of their business organizational structure, Web3 organizations are also highly interoperable with teams of data aggregators compiling satellite data, which can automatically be channeled into these systems.

[^41]: G. Booman et. al.,”Regen Network Whitepaper,” Version 1.3, (February 15th, 2021).


The transparency of interactions that occur on a Web3 organizational blockchain ledger ensures that any payments generated through smart contractual relationships are totally accounted for and the carbon credit claimant is clear, eliminating the possibility of double counting[^42].

**A hypothetical application**

The government is currently at work to subsidize a nationwide transition to Climate Smart Agricultural practices. The resulting programs can be executed, in relationship with farmers, through smart contracts that can channel them carbon credits as they execute this transition[^43].

[^43]: National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, “$1 Billion Available for Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities,” NSAC Blog, (February 24th, 2022). [Link.](https://sustainableagriculture.net/blog/1-billion-available-for-partnerships-for-climate-smart-commodities/)


**Real Case study: Blockchain for Climate Foundation uses Non-Fungible Tokens to enhance international carbon market impact**[^44]

[^44]: See: [https://www.blockchainforclimate.org/](https://www.blockchainforclimate.org/)


Blockchain for Climate Foundation (BCF) has built a blockchain based platform to enable national governments of the world to issue and exchange Paris Agreement carbon credits as non-fungible tokens. The Blockchain Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes Platform (BITMO Platform) stands ready for operation by each nation’s “National Focal Point to a Party to the UNFCCC[^45].” to tokenize emissions reductions & removals that the US government and others nations would like to enable for international transfer. Each token, equivalent to one tonne of CO2 equivalent has all pertinent carbon credit data embedded right into the NFT.

Amongst all the compelling uses of blockchain technology to address climate change, the BCF team has focused on building a pathway for countries of the world to finally operationalize Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. This critical article lays out the rules and procedures for international collaboration on emissions reductions and governance of cross-border carbon markets. It is the hope of BCF that the BITMO Platform can fulfill a critical infrastructure role by enabling corresponding adjustments and immediate settlement of trades for national carbon inventories. Emissions reductions outcomes are the most important, and soon to be among the most valuable, assets of the world. The BITMO Platform links opportunity to reduce emissions with capital and demand, creating the future we need, faster.

_Building trust in carbon markets_

Climate change can only be beaten with international collaboration. Well-functioning, efficient,trusted carbon markets allow capital to flow where it can be best used to reduce emissions and make life better. Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) contemplated under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement hold unparalleled promise as a vehicle to enable a powerful global carbon market. Yet in the flexibility and adaptability of ITMOs lie their potential undoing - as issuance of an ITMO alone will not be sufficient to ascertain underlying quality. Unmitigated, this presents an unacceptable risk to market participants and overseeing governments. Providing a prime example of the potential of Web3 tools to improve this area, Blockchain for Climate has designed the BITMO Dashboard to allow fast, easy, transparent demonstration of ITMO quality - enabling governments and buyers to easily assess and trust the quality of emissions reductions outcomes.

_Federal legislation and engagement_

Adoption of the BITMO Platform is ultimately up to each national signatory to the Paris Agreement. We are convening a working group of National Parties (the entity within national governments responsible for engaging with the UNFCCC) to help vision and establish a tool to operationalize Article 6 of the Paris Agreement using the blockchain. National Party participants will be invited to provide feedback on existing design and plans, highlighting both aspects of good fit, as well as any items that may be showstoppers for their adoption of this blockchain technology.

The ultimate goal of a Web3 organization like Blockchain for Climate is to create champions and users of the BITMO Platform. Herein lies a **specific example of the value of US government regulation that would be critical to enabling enhanced use of web3** to enable investment, commerce and climate action in the United States. Overall, regulators would do well to contemplate the value of these platforms based on their projected use, and then ensure that users feel confident in the security of the platforms to facilitate their onboarding processes.

## 3.  Climate-crypto sector insights to help address issues prioritized by this executive order
    

The executive order emphasizes the need for federal regulation that manages the following aspects of digital asset development in the blockchain financial sector. This coalition offers climate crypto examples to illustrate the potential of web3 projects to advance the following executive order objectives, while greatly enhancing the efficiency and integrity of carbon market finance:

1.  Prevent illicit finance
    

As stated above, cryptocurrencies, because they are tracked on public ledgers and hosted at exchanges that provide numerous verification checkpoints preventing fraud, render financial criminal activity very difficult. However, questions remain about how the federal government can ensure the appropriate level of surveillance and enforcement without overly compromising financial privacy or eliminating efficiency benefits[^46].

[^46]: Financial sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, and the arrest of two Americans for laundering billions of dollars of bitcoin, have placed a spotlight on the illicit finance and national security implications of digital assets. See: Kevin Werbach, “A Turning Point for Digital Asset Regulation,” The Regulatory Review, (May 14th, 2022). [Link.](https://www.theregreview.org/2022/03/14/werbach-turning-point-digital-asset-regulation/)



The Web3 carbon market sector acknowledges that organizations and carbon registries solely utilizing the internet, and not Web3 tools, notoriously have been able to fraudulently funnel huge amounts of money from carbon markets into low-impact or even abusive projects[^47]. Web-based carbon credit projects have had huge issues combatting double counting. The most lucid example of this is the United Nations program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD)[^48]. Plenty of safeguards are now in place in conventional web-based carbon market institutions. However, climate crypto entities are pursuing the question of how to implement further safeguards against double-counting using blockchain-based tools within the carbon market industry to infuse the process of legitimizing carbon credit claims with lack of trust. The BICOWG believes that the design capabilities that Web3 tools afford projects allow for radically transparent verification systems that promise to eliminate double counting altogether. Governance and operators governing layer 1 blockchain ledgers[^49] are vital to carbon emissions tracking work.

**Central regulatory note**: The federal government has perhaps the most significant opportunity to formulate regulations that convert Web3 tools, including digital assets, into the foundational elements of an entirely transparent carbon offset market financial sector free from double-counting and fraud. To form such regulations, regulators need to be informed about the trust assumptions within verification processes Web3 projects are developing. Many projects are moving project models for accessing carbon market funds onto Web3 technology, but are not significantly reforming their ecosystem outcome verification processes. Thus they are transferring methodologies used by REDD+ projects that have resulted in fraud, double-counting and even land-trafficking in the past. There is thus a major trust schism in incumbent carbon market spaces that divides actors asking the question of (1) how to tokenize existing system[^50] and (2) how to innovate a more transparent, efficient system of allocating carbon market funds to high-impact projects with Web3 tools. We provide [Recommendations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12KSfzvStSbTr1hOI3fg0Li8gF81C4f8Sfz0Z3eozNJ4/edit?pli=1#heading=h.v9647d81bn63) below regarding how to promote a favorable regulatory environment to support the innovation of more transparent carbon market fund pathways.

2.  Ensure that digital asset technologies and the digital payments ecosystem are developed, designed, and implemented in a responsible manner that reduces negative climate impacts and environmental pollution, as may result from some cryptocurrency mining.
    

Currently, Blockchains do have an energy problem[^51]. The industry is addressing this[^52]. More than 250 companies and individuals have joined including the Crypto Climate Accord as supporters[^53]. The Crypto Climate Accord’s overall objective is to decarbonize the global crypto industry by prioritizing climate stewardship and supporting the entire crypto industry’s transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040[^54]. Furthermore, a large majority of the blockchain sector is actively transitioning to proof of stake from proof of work. This transition promises to enhance the governance and transparency of blockchain networks, as well as reduce their energy demands[^55].

[^51]: Blockchain operations (For e.g. Bitcoin’s estimated power consumption) soared from an annual rate of 6.6 terawatt-hours at the start of 2017 to 138 terawatt-hours in early 2022 -- more than a country like Norway -- according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, which keeps a running estimate.

3.  Reinforce US leadership in global financial system: payment innovations and dig assets, how to hold U.S.’s central role in global markets by dollar?[^56]

[^56]: Executive order priority

It is paramount to recognize that Web3 technologies allow companies based in the U.S. to access funds from global carbon markets. Transparent, Web3-based climate crypto organizations (operating in favorable regulatory environments) will surely draw in huge quantities of capital from global carbon markets, creating a force that can drive real investment and climate transition in the United States and beyond. The expansive nature of the Web3 sector will allow the sectors of organizations developing innovative carbon offset projects to scale as quickly as possible[^57].

[Link.](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/a-blueprint-for-scaling-voluntary-carbon-markets-to-meet-the-climate-challenge)

At the local level, community banks control the flow of billions of dollars to small businesses, farms and local communities[^58]. Climate crypto entities seek to facilitate the process of these banks distributing compensation for the creation of ecological value, especially ecosystem services that contribute to community health and climate change reversal[^59].

**Case Study: Application of Web3 to create ecosystem health-backed currency**

The complex valuation of tokens using data surrounding ecological health, as is used to back the tokens in the Regen Network ecosystem, creates the possibility that these companies will allow the U.S. dollar to be channeled towards ecosystem restoration in exponentially more efficient ways[^60]. Such innovations place Web3 carbon finance organizations at the forefront of impactful climate finance pathways. They enforce that it is paramount for the federal government to regulate such organizations in a supportive way to both maintain U.S. leadership in the global financial system, and improve the impact of U.S. leadership by greatly facilitating the capacity of the U.S. dollar to fund ecosystem-based climate change resilience and reversal projects.

**Stablecoin Insight: how does having a progressive U.S. stablecoin relate to maintaining global financial leadership**

The executive order “places the highest urgency on research and development efforts” into a potential U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC). Ever since China announced the digital currency research project it started in 2017, which culminated in the country’s e-CNY “digital yuan,” concern has grown that the dollar’s global dominance is under threat. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston developed a CBDC proof of concept with the MIT Digital Currency Initiative. But the United States trails behind places such as China, England, and the European Union in investigating how a CBDC might overcome the limitations of existing payment rails and provide a new foundation for monetary policy[^61]. It is vital that regulators use insights within this document -- about the explosive potential of using Web3 tools to innovate assets that facilitate mass-scale coordination around creating ecosystem service and carbon offset value -- to inform their stablecoin regulatory strategy, and promote an expansive, high-impact digital asset sector in the United States.

## 4.  Recommendations
    

#### Five recommendations to create favorable regulatory environment for fully transparent carbon offset verification pathways

All regulation in this space should create tax incentives for registries and other intermediaries seeking capital from voluntary and mandatory carbon markets that choose to integrate highly transparent blockchain-based infrastructure within their organizations. This regulation is vital to provide a “carrot” to initiatives that implement best practices and abide by legislation, and create a “stick” mechanism to punish those who do not.

→ **Recommendation 1**: Keep in mind the dichotomy between reform-oriented Web3 projects that are making their chains totally transparent and projects that are merely using corporate verification chains that are not fully transparent. Regulators want to create a favorable environment for projects that have changed their verification protocols since the REDD+ scandals, and place regulatory pressure on entities that have not and are going into the next round of market scaling with a set of approaches that have been shown to be flawed - verification, governance, software.

→ **Recommendation 2**. Regulations are needed that push carbon registries to monitor and ensure that all project registries have responsible verification systems and are working with an appropriately robust and resilient structure. The BICOWG recommends that the government favor a pluralistic approach: Regulate in favor of mechanistically resilient methodologies provided by on-chain solutions that can satisfy the needs of improving today’s traditional carbon markets.

→ **Recommendation 3**: Allow Web3 tools to help carbon registries lower the cost of auditing claims to as close to zero as possible, and de-incentivize opaque auditing processes.

There is a risk that Web3 climate crypto organizations will transfer carbon offset verification methodologies directly from the traditional web-based systems, because doing so is very affordable. Yet within these old systems, it is very expensive to audit individual carbon offset impact claims - a process which requires interfacing with various intermediaries that do not have interoperable organization infrastructure. The high expense of auditing claims renders it unlikely that each claim will be audited, leaving a lot of uncertainty about the veracity of multiple claims. Other web3 organizations, hoping to positively reform the carbon market financial sector, aim to create public infrastructure for totally transparent, public accounting processes. They encourage regulators to pass rules stating that carbon accounting should not be happening behind closed doors through opaque accounting processes. Ideologically, the carbon offset market is intended to be a market coordinating the execution of climate change reversal efforts for the public good. The coordination of this market should be executed in a radically transparent and open-sourced pathway using aligned web3 tools and regulation that requires traditional web-based organizations to report their methodologies and activities; to render the organizations as transparent as their web3 counterparts.

→ **Recommendation 4**: The web3 climate crypto space provides a clear foundation to integrate actors who are accountable for preventing double counting in the traditional carbon market sector. Existing standard-setting bodies need to take responsibility, perhaps due to regulatory action that compels them to articulate and enforce their standards in the web3 space. These can include the management of cryptographic keys and oversight of the composable protocols that interact with each other in a setting of ‘green money legos’. This transfer of standards will be a central step towards rendering all carbon market activity using Web3 tools transparent and compliant with existing standards. For example, the biggest issue with the Verra carbon registry is there is no system in place of accounting for and reporting instances in which Verra-approved methodologies have been used to commit fraud or for double counting impact to obtain credit assets[^62]. Web3 organizations are hoping that they can provide immutable chains through which Verra credits can be issued, and corresponding carbon market assets can be transferred, to eliminate fraudulent transactions through the registry. Without these tools there is a risk that Verra will lose control over their credits to the activity of bad actors, and they will depreciate in value.

[^62]: See the Verra archives for brief reports about double counting issues: [https://verra.org/tag/double-counting/](https://verra.org/tag/double-counting/)


→ **Recommendation 5**: Support the web3 carbon bridge sector in its task to increase the transparency and integrity of carbon accounting systems, challenging carbon registries

The Web3, climate crypto sector of development will determine whether flaws within carbon registries persist, or are eliminated, increasing the integrity of the carbon offset market finance sector. Regulators should keep in mind that existing Web2 carbon registries are centralized organizations that may use their power to shut down accounts that challenge their methodologies too dramatically. Regulators should support progressive climate crypto companies as they strike to challenge existing registry methodologies[^63].

[^63]: The International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) could play a particularly influential role in supporting this task.

#### Further recommendations:

_1.  Support Participatory, community governance of carbon market development_
    

The carbon market digital asset sector needs precompetitive public infrastructure for community governance in this space to help it achieve its full impact. Regulators should do all they can to create a favorable regulatory environment for decentralized community governance forums. Organizations operating as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) while building their carbon market project forums are examples of such forums.

_2.  Regulations need to move from stating that “carbon credits should only come from existing registries” to → “Existing registries should partner with web3 entities to facilitate the establishment of robust, transparent carbon credits” that make genuine offset impact_
    

Many participants in the climate crypto sector have active interest in working to guide and shape the regulations that will involve their industries as well as the ones transitioning to a Web3 version. The International Emissions Trading Association’s (IETA) work and guidance has provided initial groundwork for a starting point of how carbon credits can come from existing registries[^64]. This foundation is just a start and many believe there can be open collaboration to shape the industry together.

[^64]: Jennifer L., “IETA Releases Guidelines on Blockchain Use in Carbon Markets,” Carbon Credits.com, (March 30th, 2022). See: [https://carboncredits.com/blockchain-use-in-carbon-markets/](https://carboncredits.com/blockchain-use-in-carbon-markets/)

For all the reasons detailed above, about how web3 tools can radically improve the deployment of carbon offset finance towards climate change reversal initiatives, It is of the upmost importance that the federal government not only allow but **incentivize the tokenization** of carbon credit value. The government could review the infrastructure of decentralized carbon bridge blockchain entities for themselves, and develop a definition of “best practice” carbon offset tokenization. Then if agencies agree that decentralized bridge structures are the most effective and ethical organizations to aid in distributing carbon offset funds, they should develop incentive schemes to encourage carbon registries to partner with these organizations.

**Example**: Regen Network shares a vision of how to use web3 tools to achieve this goal. The Regen Network aims to create a system in which carbon market participants begin to engage the Regen community and onboard onto the Regen ledger of the Cosmos blockchain to render all their activity transparent, simultaneously becoming familiar with registries. Then Regen can invite the registries to establish their presence on the Regen ledger, and connect with validators also present in the Regen community at work to track activity. Alternatively, if a registry needs complete sovereignty and just wants to interoperate with a web3 entity, they can create a node: a “proof of authority Cosmos SDK chain” to operate in a permissionless pathway that is seamlessly interoperable with the carbon bridge system. The infrastructure service providers like stakefish and networks like Regen can easily generate white label solutions to help registries become their own validator entities.

_3.  Regulate to favor the development of decentralized web3-based carbon bridges_
    

As explained on page 10, the decentralized and centralized web3 carbon bridges are two different applications of the same carbon market infrastructure. However, decentralized carbon bridges are leagues more accessible to the public. A grounding example is that many are generating digitally unique assets representing ecological health that a huge range of ecosystem stewards can access through simple smart contracts. The BICOWG working group recommends that these assets be governed by a federal, multi-stakeholder initiative to support the dispersal of subsidies for climate outcomes, not merely carbon registries[^65].

[^65]: Desired funding mechanism: free market carbon, continuous streaming PES, bonds and world bank programs for results (cite big news on this recently). Potential to automate and have multi-stakeholder governance of this process. (Recommended by stakefish).

**Rec: Support commodification of climate action & improvements to the economy**

Real progress on regulating digital assets will require action by all federal financial regulatory authorities—SEC, CFTC, OCC, FDIC, Fed, CFPB, FinCEN, OFAC, IRS—and most likely congressional action as well. We encourage these regulatory bodies that Web3 tools have the ability to create genuine payment streams for climate action.

Climate crypto organizations are not making commodities out of commons: this sector is attempting to make commodities out of human driven improvements to global ecological commons. This sector will provoke tremendous progress forward from an extractive, conventional finance system. The goal of this sector is to make it a possibility that carbon offsets are required to contribute to ecological regeneration or conservation action.

-   Creating payments for ecosystem improvements and fund stream to compensate labor that was not compensated previously
    

-   Trying to pay individuals to do work to offset carbon, restore ecosystems.
    

**Final Recommendation:  The United States should aim to become internationally competitive in this digital asset sector while also enhancing its status as a climate change and 0-poverty[^66] leader**

[^66]: Referencing the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), See: [https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/poverty/](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/poverty/)


Enforce that the United States does not simply seek to reign new web3 tools into compliance with existing, highly dysfunctional systems. Rather, adopt the stance that the United States wants to promote innovation, to enhance public welfare and ecosystem health, in the finance sector by using web3 tools to enable mass-scale coordination around public welfare objectives. In doing so, the United States can both keep pace with the in  creasing pace of finance system innovation in Estonia, Taiwan[^67] and the European Union[^68], and act as a leader compelling global financial markets utilizing these new tools to also enhance public good through climate change reversal in this era of socio-environmental crisis.
